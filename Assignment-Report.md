## Q1: Number of unique pages

How many unique pages did you find? Uniqueness is established by the URL, but discarding the fragment part. So, for example, http://www.ics.uci.edu#aaa and http://www.ics.uci.edu#bbb are the same URL.

As far as we know, we have crawled xxx unique pages, which followed the rules:
- Skip `https://gitlab.ics.uci.edu/*`
- 

However, we did not actually crawl all the web pages in the requirements, because of:
- Network issues
  - Max entries
  - Cache server being shut down
  - VPN connection
- Text processing
  - Slow
